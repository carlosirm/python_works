# 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
# independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

favorite_fruits = ['guayaba','cambur','guanabana','piña','melón']
for fruit in favorite_fruits:
	if fruit == 'guayaba':
		print ('LA guayaba es excelente, cremosa y dulce')
	elif fruit == 'cambur':
		print ('siempre es bueno algo de potasio')
	else:
		print ('Al menos comes fruta...')

# • Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
# is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,
# such as You really like bananas!
