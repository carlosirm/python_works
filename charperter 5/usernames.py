# 5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
# 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
# after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
# each user:
# • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
# would you like to see a status report?
# • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging
# in again.
# 5-9. No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
# not empty.
# • If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
# • Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
# message is printed.
